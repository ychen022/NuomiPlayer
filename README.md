# NuomiPlayer - Android Auto Music Companion

🚗🎶 NuomiPlayer is an Android Auto companion app that extends in-car playback experience by **mirroring media metadata and controls from your phone**, providing a cleaner UI, richer info, and **time-synced lyrics**.

I built this after realizing that **QQ Music does not support Android Auto**, while many Android Auto–ready apps don’t include the songs I listen to most. Existing workarounds were either outdated or unstable (e.g., frequent crashes), so I decided to build a lightweight and reliable solution for my own daily driving.

> Note: I had little prior Android app experience. To accelerate development, part of the **phone playback UI** was adapted from the open-source project **Booming Music** (see Credits). If any usage violates the original license, please contact me and I will promptly fix or remove the relevant code.
